@yohkatheryn that's up to your ears darling!
@CottonCandyKaty OY OY OY!
@KarolynaDiaz so basically my birthday is all about you guys this year!
@maayansharvit You're welcome. Self love is such an import foundation to have before falling in love.
@777candygirl777 I wrote This Moment in 1 day it took me 5 months to finish Choose Your Battles. Some come out like waterfalls others drip!
@theprismcess I was influenced to write it after discovering a bunch of people roller skating to deep house in Central Park this summer!
@mserthal it's my 3rd album (why are ppl saying this) &amp; I wrote about 26 songs or so for the record &amp; not all of them fit! Best ones made it
@camisp_ I have a few great ideas BUT... I will take submissions?!?!
@lucasgaldin I wrote "we could be legendary lovers" in an email and from the moment I wrote it I knew it was going to be a song!
@katyskettle Unconditionally, of course!
@prixy_mtz it's inspired by owning up to my part of the responsibility in a situation.
@zennnnaaa it's like someone falling in love with a witch! Influenced by the movie The Craft!
@emileewright23 best pumpkin ever!
@KatyisSmurfy finally an INVITE!
@dadehoward I read the book "The Power of Now" and that's what inspired it... With a romantic twist!
@KyleDSaavedra I will be physically closer to you than I was on the last...
@KatyCatKrystal caught.
@ItsLittleMartha I refuse to talk about this until hover boards actually exist.
@KatysDoritos my OG crew, our parties &amp; my hometown SANTA BARBARA! Even my favorite taco joint gets a shout out!
@pendejabardera self reflection, love &amp; light...
@rosenilsou I just shot it in London last week...
@hackensucks that everyone can identify with a song on the record, there's something for everyone! #somanycolors
@ismaellgarcia acceptance is the key to be, to be truly free. #letthelightin
@milegendz because it's my FAVORITE one on the record &amp; the message is so universal but diverse about the subject of Love.
@alexskarev this was actually the most fun I've ever had making a record because i had no rules &amp; no timeline just complete freedom!
@LadyCrystalB I think I'm living the most present &amp; aware I have ever lived &amp; that made this time even better. Maybe I've finally grown up?
@xCallMeChrissyx I feel like it represents so many different sides of me but is the most lyrically dense/vulnerable record I've made so far.
@ArianaStylesss I wrote and recorded the first song back "By the Grace of God" Nov, 2012. MOST of the record was written spring 2013 though.

Argentina I do love you. It is in fact one of my favorite places to tour. I wish this was not the case. My lawyers say it is what it is.

So fans shouldn't have to choose. Music is about sharing and lifting eachother up. I love music for what it can do for us. Much love
When it comes to music we shouldn't be put up against eachother. Music isn't about competition it is about collaboration. It's a language

In case you're wondering if this is some exclusive deal like you've seen Apple do with other artists, it's not.
After the events of this week, I've decided to put 1989 on Apple Music...and happily so.

So.. Anything could happen at one of our LA shows. @elliegoulding showed up to sing 'anything could happen'! 15,000 person dance party.
So.... @teganandsara just came out and surprised the crowd with 'Closer' and made an entire sold out Staples crowd DANCE. Unreal!!!
I wanna see you be brave. @SaraBareilles @STAPLESCenter http://t.co/2rdaN921iF

To everyone who came to the show tonight in LA, I adore you. To anyone coming to the next 3 shows, expect more of the unexpected :)
One of my favorite moments of the night was @CherLloyd coming out to sing 'Want U Back'. The crowd went insane!! And she's such a fun girl!
Tonight at Staples was an absolute DREAM. @SaraBareilles came out to sing 'Brave', one of my favorite songs. And she completely smashed it!!

Just took a walk around the stadium we're playing in tonight in Toronto- It took a while. Two nights playing here?? No complaints.
I heard @caitlinbird running through the house screaming. At first I thought she was being murdered. Turned out she saw a rainbow outside.

@thecivilwars My 1st thought upon hearing of our 2 Grammy noms for Safe &amp; Sound was 'may the odds be ever in our favor' and I'm not sorry.
Honored to also be nominated for 2 Grammys with @thecivilwars for 'Safe and Sound' on @thehungergames soundtrack. Unreal! #GrammyNomination
After...... (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) http://t.co/kwQwrd2R
Before...... http://t.co/WIqyR5fx
I'll be co-hosting the Grammy Nominations Concert live from Nashville tonight! 10/9c on CBS. Headed to rehearsals now. Psyched.
In the dressing room at the ARIA's. Loving Australia. http://t.co/wtrjI2eo
Woah. The fans at the ARIAs came out in full force!! This is INSANE!
So excited about performing on the ARIA's tonight! Never been before. Here's comes 'trouble'.... See what I did there? Sorry. I know. Sorry.
Seeing this makes me so happy. http://t.co/4knthS3d
Just tried reading a hotel shampoo bottle an arms length away from my face to check if I still need contacts-Turns out I do. Eventful night.
Now we're off to Australia, where @GrantMickelson will undoubtedly refer to koalas as 'panda bears' no matter how many times we correct him.
Leaving Tokyo. I'll miss you guys. Thank you for your lovely hospitality and cat-related gifts. :)
I'm thankful for friendships like this. http://t.co/KKiS2IUO
Last night my band, crew, and I ate Japanese food and went around the table saying what we're thankful for. I could've gone on for an hour.
Time to play my nightly game of "where are the light switches in this hotel room?"
Landed in Japan a few hours ago- thank you to all the wonderful fans at the airport for your adorable gifts and adorable-ness in general :)
Thank you so much for the AMA! You're unreal. I went straight from the awards to a night video shoot. Long day but so worth it.
Walked into my AMA dressing room and there was this little bowl of candy in there. Literally shrieked with excitement. Need to tone it down.
Had a blast playing on #xfactorUSA. Also, @Ddlovato's hair looks SO good tonight.
I'll be on @TheXFactorUSA tonight at 8 ET on FOX. So stoked.
Such an insane night!!! You guys won me 3 EMAs! Best female, best live act, best look. Can't even begin to thank you enough. I love you!!
Backstage @MTVEMA.. My band and I are walking around in our costumes, taking hilarious pictures. Can't WAIT for this.
EMA rehearsals in Frankfurt!! Yay! (Blows nose. Sniffles. Then coughs. Blows nose again. Apologizes to everyone in vicinity.)
Got a cold. I'm carrying around a box of tissues like it's my new favorite accessory, sneezing excessively, talking like a frog/old man.
Got to help switch on the lights at Westfield tonight in London and lots of people showed up and we played a few songs and I had fun. :)
Just walked the red carpet at the CMAs.. Who's gonna watch tonight? Cool thanks :)
@Miranda_Lambert just read your tweet-- thank you!!! That made me so happy. Can't wait to see you tonight!
They just told me Red sold 1.2 million albums first week. How is this real life?! You are UNREAL. I love you so much. Thanks a million ;)

There's a preview of a brand new song from Red tomorrow morning on @GMA.. It's called 'I Knew You Were Trouble.' And it's one of my favssss.
I feel like I'd be more understood if people knew 'I Don't Want to Miss a Thing' by Aerosmith is how most of my emotions sound in my head.
My glitter nail polish says 'party' but my sweat pants/bun on top of head ensemble say 'room service and journaling my feelings'.
I might be sleep walking. I'm definitely sleep walking.

@piersmorgan I've work w/ our VP Joe Biden on helping educate people about why women don't report, would love to share it w/ you some time.
@Madonna your speech at the Billboard Music Awards was inspiring. You're so brave &amp; strong. Thanks for being that for us girls we need that.

I wish it was illegal to use any form of hate-speech when the final candidates are campaigning for presidency.
@AngieTVtvShow @periscopeco we're watching u , Dope watching u dance to #JOANNE
@holyh00ker all I can do today is think of every single one of you, u are not alone
@Monster4Gaga24 U are absolutely right. But there's hateful extreme groups that he empowered that I fear will grow now that he won.
@Monster4Gaga24 @MarisolMonster The point is his language and approach to winning was divisive and we're witnessing it's violence now.
Every parent should do this today. https://t.co/agBCNxC03s

If you feel scared about the current state of American politics and Whitehouse sign this petition: https://t.co/2K88hLD8hn
American Press, don't ignore the voices of half of USA who are in fear of their liberties and safety because of his divisive campaigning.
I wish @cnn and other news outlets would discuss the real issue we have in this country. Half of the population is in a state of fear.

@nicolexgaga nobody laughed but u thank u haha
@hopelessrocker @ViviLittleM I UNDERSTOOD THE WHOLE TIME HELLO. Calling a vine a gif is funny! A fancy one at that! Nobody laughed, sadly.
@honeyMiich YAS u and I see it exactly the same
@BlackBoyMiah do i need to understand a pineapple to eat a banana.
@Pablonauta_ hmm I wouldn't say serious in quite good w a computer it's just this vine distinction were on about
@gagasgrande I just like talking to everyone it's interesting what people say
@HolyGagAllah but Isn't a "video" a series of moving photos that give the illusion of motion. And so are gifs.
@ViviLittleM gifs are not vines, but a vine could be an evolution of the gif no?
@skulltatttoo I'm trying to figure out why the distinction is so important.
@BxhindTheAura .gif + .gif + .gif + .gif + .gif + .gif  + music and maybe some FX or titles if u want = Vine am I getting warmer
@JustCallMeSeann is it like "jiff" y peanut butter or of the "guilty" g pronunciation
@Nutellandro but will this 6 second .gif with music change the world I don't know. Weird to hear it called technology. Communication maybe?
@jessicxh or perhaps a "fancy .gif"
@GagaSlaysUU @arparetyma so it's a gif w sound
@arparetyma isn't vine a company and .gif is what inspired vine? Or am I missing something important

WATCH PREVIEW: BANG BANG Live from PBS #CheekToCheek Special. Full video coming this week! http://t.co/whE8km5q2Q
SURPRISE: Here's a preview of my live BANG BANG performance. Loved this so much we added it to the album on iTunes. Recorded live in 1 take!
@LalaWhine In a world with growing violence and fear, we hope to inspire a simpler time. Music for your hearts to meditate and feel happy.
.@LM_M3RT It's the greatest art form to emerge from America. Created by the African American community. #AskTonyAndGaga
.@MyMamasMonster It was recorded during a live show. My trumpet player was my ex-BF's best friend. Performance was emotional for both of us.
.@JuancaSpace Tony is MY Frank. What he has done for me will change my career forever. And I truly cherish our friendship. #AskTonyAndGaga
.@JuancaSpace Tony told me Frank Sinatra changed his life when he said "For my money, Tony Bennett is the best singer in the business." ...
.@AmyGaga1D I thought of her almost every day in the studio. I wish she was still here. She was jazz to her core. #AskTonyAndGaga
.@KingLadyGaga We're just letting the world know, we're about to make BIG SWINGIN' HEADLINES. #AskTonyAndGaga
.@hausofrobert Ev'ry song was recorded live in studio w/ band at the same time. No autotune. All recordings are single takes #AskTonyAndGaga
.@0andoni0 I feel freer singing jazz, it's my roots. It's rebellious. The more rules u break the better u r at improvising. #AskTonyAndGaga
.@LGMonsterFacts It was difficult to get through LUSH LIFE without crying. That song is autobiographical for me. Tony coached me through it.
@lcGAGA_ "Sophisticated Lady" Tony's solo. Because he sang it to me, as a message and a gift. I cry every time I hear it. #AskTonyAndGaga
.@iTunesMusic I hope to spread jazz to the younger generation, its joy, its authenticity. And to honor Mr. Tony Bennett. #AskTonyAndGaga
.@iTunesMusic A lesson he passed to me from his best friend Duke Ellington who told him "#1, don't quit. #2, listen to #1" #AskTonyAndGaga
.@iTunesMusic No one can replicate the genius of those composers, but that's the beauty of music. Evolution. #AskTonyAndGaga
.@iTunesMusic His heart is as big as his legacy. Timeless. Classic. Forever. A legend from the inside out. #AskTonyAndGaga

Another 4 STAR REVIEW of #CheekToCheek by music connoisseur Will Hodgkinson Read Below/Sign Up:http://t.co/5MVYZqffzr http://t.co/W6lsekBQis
@KingLadyGaga We wanted to keep the focus on the beauty of the scent &amp; simplicity of love. Not a dark tale, a timeless one. Like the song.
@thatsNathan #EauDeGaga is very different from the dark 'FAME' This is why we kept the film timeless, forever, Classic. Like Love, Like Jazz
@LabOfHookers because the boxer has wounds in his eyes, fighting for my love!
@ARTinesPOP Both! But Eau De Gaga is truly special because it is really for everyone.
@BaesicGay it is a very romantic scent,  brings together both sexes, Tony sings to me, I sing back, the way the fragrance does, with love :)
@HausOfFanis they're fighting over me! :) or ya know, the fragrance :)
OK MONSTERS! TREND #HausLaboratories #EauDeGaga Were ALMOST THERE! We worked 2years on this fragrance. 13 NATURAL ingredients and unisex!
@BABYSWEETROSE Mental illness is a real issue, your mind is not functioning properly to make sound decisions Share your triumph, inspire.
Go To http://t.co/HTUwGaoobV to SEEK HELP, suicide it NOT the answer. We care, offer compassion, &amp; mentor the process of healing depression.

A Fabulous Review of Cheek To Cheek By Marc Myers, JAZZ EXPERT of the Wall Street Journal: http://t.co/QHCgaTTjtr
Hello, Greece: https://t.co/DygCmw5ad0
Some days it hits me so hard, reality, I can't express my gratitude enough to monsters+team for believing in me. U changed my families life.
Spent a lot of time crying today, happy tears, but many. I can't believe my life. Being able to buy nice things, travel, it's overwhelming.
Were leaving for Greece today to play the Olympic Stadium! I'm so ready! Much of ARTPOP was inspired by classical art + Pagan tradition _Ù_
@skulltatttoo @stuckonfknyou so dope you guys, were connected for life. I'm getting my monster paw tat next. It's TIME!

@littleartlover I love music period! Obsessed! Music junkie!
@RollingStone meant to not capitalize the composers name, no bother, just wanted to make sure you knew ahbez wanted his name in lower case!
Show starts in 1 hr 45 min! Were gonna make art in the spirit of rave, and rave in support of the art! LETS GO TURKEY! #artRAVEIstanbul
@GagasGirI true!
Listen to 'NATURE BOY' by @itstonybennett + me, from #CheekToCheek! http://t.co/W1l8C9IZdV RT and preorder new album http://t.co/zu4nMBCmZq
TREND IT Monsters! #TonyGagaNatureBoyOnVevo Lets bring jazz to the whole world for these great composers! We can do it!
Ok no more informative tweets!----&gt;jazz nerd. Just close your eyes and enjoy "NATURE BOY" in 1hr33 minutes! #ThankUMonstersForSupportingJazz
It's just so interesting. This composer was part of a sub-culture of nomadic hippies! We channelled our own Gypsy lives in this performance.
It wasn't until 1947 that the song was published, written sometime during/after 1941 while pianist Ahbez wandered LA eating only raw fruits.
@TriniBoyStephon lies! :)
You will hear his genius in the flute solo of our "NATURE BOY" a solo that will echo through the world today. And forever. #TheGreatPaulHorn
Horn was meant to join Tony &amp; me for the PBS special but sadly passed just weeks before, a New Age Jazz pioneer, lets celebrate him 2day.
You will recognize it also famously as used in 'Moulin Rouge,' but our rendition with the now late multi-reedist Paul Horn is spectacular.
Nature Boy was composed in 1941 by eden ahbez, a wandering man from Brooklyn with long hair. It was recorded first by Nat King Cole in 1947.
'Nature Boy' from #CheekToCheek will officially be available to stream on VEVO in 2 hrs &amp; 11 minutes! This is one of my absolute FAVORITES!
I lay in bed, and hear the sounds of new melodies. Repeating over and over. Inspiration, a tear falls down, I taste it. Stomach turning.

Thank you for making these shows so memorable, for strengthening our monster community, and being bad kids like you always are. I love you.
Last night, when I sang the lyric "its you and me baby for life," hundreds at once held up signs that said "for life."
Every 'Gypsy' performance at Australian Artrave's monsters held hands at the back of the arena by the piano and danced in a circle.
#CheekToCheek is COMING SEPT 23 RT! @itstonybennett

@seashellgirls lush life
@FionaLovesGaga yes exactly, we picked our favorites of many many we recorded. The album tells a love story.
@MonstersSpain the one Tony sings to me. "Sophisticated Lady"
@GiuliaMonster_ we named the album after 'cheek to cheek' the Irving Berlin song.  Me &amp; Tony are bringing that romance into the future.
You can find many versions of these songs online, but the best way is to buy vinyl.  Much is not available digitally. And the crackle IS :)
Anything Goes was written by Cole Porter in 1934, Cole Porter was and is widely known as one of the greatest jazz lyricists ever.
For those monsters who wanna learn more about jazz I thought as the song come out I'd tell you about them.

or another option is having 2 iPhones. I really want my blackberry bold though. Reality is starting to set in &amp; I'm getting sad
I need 2 phones. Because I love having 2 different phone services so I always have a working phone.
Do I try a different kind of blackberry? Or ditch it all together? Or a different phone like Samsung?

This will now prevent him from receiving the compensation he deserves for the decades he spent on death row.

These are the types of media stories I  Google when I can't sleep
His chargers were just dropped after DNA evidence was finally brought in and cleared him. Can u imagine being wrongly imprisoned for 40 yrs

Thank you The Daily Mail for changing your headline! I really do love your site!
those that rant together...
I've brought my babies over friends/fam houses, parks &amp; restaurants but because a picture wasn't taken it didn't happen &amp; I'm in exile? smh
Certainly not in a self imposed diet exile. Thats ridic!
Isn't it just called maternity leave? If coming to NYC support my husband &amp; have so enjoyed my time at home with my babies &amp; family.
So I'm reading The Daily Mail, which I love btw but this headline isn't cool. "Kim emerges from self imposed diet exile" REALLY?!

My thoughts &amp; prayers go out to Valerie Jackson's family and friends!  #GunLawsHAVEtoChange #GunSafety #BackgroundChecksNecessary
These gun safety laws have to change! This poor woman was tied up &amp; saw every child of hers &amp; husband get executed over 10 hours!
He purchased the gun &amp; ammo ONLINE! How is it so easy to purchase guns online!!! Does this not sicken you? No background checks needed!!!!!

Wishing all of the moms out there a happy &amp; healthy pregnancy &amp; delivery! #MiracleFromGod #Blessed
I'm grateful to God for this miracle &amp; no matter what rumors or comments you throw my way this time they truly don't affect me!
&amp; luckier to not have preeclampsia so far, so I don't have the swelling issue! They also say your body carries a boy different than a girl
I've learned to love my body at every stage! I'm going to get even bigger &amp; that's beautiful too! I'm blessed to even be pregnant!
U know me well enough 2know I would document the process if I got a surrogate.Everyone's body is different,every pregnancy is very different
Some days I'm photographed before I eat &amp; look smaller, some days I've just eaten &amp; I look bigger. It's all a part of the process.
First they say I'm too skinny so I have to be faking it...Now they say I'm too big so I have to be faking it...SMH! http://t.co/oSrR7dMImi

If u only saw Northie's reaction! As a mom I got protective and left that scary moment out of the episode for her privacy
But as a mother this as the scariest things that could have happened w your child in the car. Khloe handled it so well!
The crash was so scary &amp; the way it was edited doesn't even do it justice! I keep North out of the show so we had to cut around that footage
I don't even know why I started crying after! Just so happy everyone is ok! Scariest experience of my life!
I honestly couldn't believe we had car cams on when that happened!!!!! How scary was that seriously!!!!!!!!! I always wear my seat belt now!
Seriously I'm so lucky to have a friend like @psychicmediumje he gives the best advice and the truth!!! No matter what! Had to call him up!
Love this episode!!! This trip was so much fun! Except at the car accident at the end!

.@iTunesMusic @jgalkin14 Everytime #AskBritney
.@iTunesMusic @ReadySetRock75 Alien #AskBritney
.@iTunesMusic You get to be Britney Bitch ;) #AskBritney
Especially because it's a greatest hits show. I just hope Vegas is ready! ;) #AskBritney
.@iTunesMusic SO excited!! I'm counting down the days to December 27th! I REALLY think this is going to be my best show ever... #AskBritney
.@iTunesMusic Loving @lordemusic right now, such a unique talent. @MileyCyrus of course. I think she made an amazing album. #AskBritney
.@iTunesMusic Work Bitch is shaping up to be an incredible number in my Vegas residency. I think my fans are going to LOVE it. #AskBritney
I dont think anyone ever thought they would see a @Tip feature on one of my albums :) #AskBritney
.@iTunesMusic The features may be surprising, but I'm really excited to have my sister @jamielynnspears &amp; @Tip on the record... #AskBritney
I tend to write from experience, but also enjoy fantasizing &amp; writing from imagination. #AskBritney
I used this album to get out everything I'd bottled up over the last few years... #AskBritney
.@iTunesMusic On this album I mostly drew from personal experience. #BritneyJean was therapeutic... #AskBritney
.@iTunesMusic Of course! I've recorded a few songs in the past specifically about my boys and they are my daily inspiration. :) #AskBritney
It also has a lot of personal songs. Songs that are very moody and vibe driven. #AskBritney
I typically make albums that are fun pop/dance records &amp; #BritneyJean has a few, but... #AskBritney
.@iTunesMusic #BritneyJean is very special to me! It's a diff album than any other album I've recorded throughout my career... #AskBritney
Q&amp;A with @iTunesMusic in an hour!
Day off... been a busy week but damn I'm going stir crazy, what's a girl to do without her dancers?!
#FlashbackFriday A #BritneyJean moment from way too long ago. My goodness time flies! http://t.co/IC97MPWcCM
Nelson Mandela was a true inspiration to all humanity. He will truly be missed.
"Perfume" video, next week on @VEVO http://t.co/lE4eymp3Zd
It warms my heart that y'all are loving #BritneyJean. Get your copy @amazonmp3 &lt;3 http://t.co/LtJvU2BiVv
Lots of love to everyone who has already gotten their copy of #BritneyJean :) MUAH! Xo http://t.co/dps446FIFx
That's it!! Thx so much for listening through the album w/ me :) I love reading what u guys think of the songs! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@ItsROfficial Your background is hilarious
Which version of #Perfume do you guys like the best? I'm not sure I could choose!! I really love both :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@califever That sounds like fun! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@SamerMajali It does have that feel a little doesn't it? #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Next Up: #NowThatIFoundYou! This song just sounds like love doesn't it? :) LOVE the music on this track! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
I think it helped set the direction for the album overall. RT @loosho @britneyspears what makes it different? #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@InsaneMia All of the Britney Army are my Brightest Morning Stars #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@KurtiusMaximus OMG too funny #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@CoolBeans_XD Love that :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@TiffanyZeyer Cute! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
#HoldOnTight is a little different from the rest of the record, but I loved writing and recording this one!! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Brightest Morning Star is a song @Sia helped me write about God :) Who is ur Brightest Morning Star? #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@dangerbritney That's what I hoped for! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@BuzzFeed Chillin' with you ;)
@WesleyWalrus Well thank you. Don't cry though! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
He suggested getting Foster The People 2 help on production. I really think they nailed it. They added a few bells &amp; the whistle on the song
When @iamwill &amp; I were finishing the song we felt it was missing something. It felt like it needed something to make the song more unique...
Funny story about that! RT @EmreAkn I love the whistle in the beginning. It gives me chills. And the lyrics are soo emotional :(
@neevebayb Means the world sweetie, thank you! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
This one was very therapeutic for me. Sometimes a girl needs to remind herself not to cry and that life will go on.
Really proud of the final version of #DontCry :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@GrantPYoung @jamielynnspears I have too! It finally felt right for this album. #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@jamielynnspears Your voice really shines on #ChillinWithYou sis!! Proud of u &lt;3
@Robin_H00d Good luck!! Thanks for tweeting along :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
She's more of a country artist and I'm obviously pop so we figured we would meet in the middle :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@hausofbliss Wait until you hear more of her music!
@brunolovesbrit @jamielynnspears That would be fun wouldn't it?? #BritneyJeanListeningParty
She's been working on her first album in Nashville for a while and I thought it would be really cool to have her on my album.
@AllexxSpears Enjoy the ride :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
.@jamielynnspears and I had SO much fun recording #ChillinWithYou!! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
I just loved this song and it spoke to me right away. RT @hausofbader The beat and lyrics are everything! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@zacharyfunk Aw thankya Zachary. Loved loved loved recording this one. #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@leogmz @katyperry Yes she is! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
My girl @KatyPerry wrote this one with @Sia and the @Diplo track is incredible :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
I fell in love with #Passenger as soon as I heard it! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@breatheheavycom Hehe!
This makes me smile! RT @alekjandro it's makes me stronger, It's helping me@cope with a broken heart &lt;/3 #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@Manon_ASP Yes ma'am #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@ElenitaSPEARS Too sweet, thank you sweetie xo #BritneyJeanListeningParty
#TilItsGone is a post-break up song, and it's true... You never really know what you have until it's gone. #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@picsoftumblr I see you now! O_O #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@leoinsiders2 A God job, wow! Ha #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@MRKiNGALEXXX You'll have to wait &amp; see ;) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
The show I'm putting together has more dance than any show I've ever done. I guess I was dancing until my body ached every single day. LOL!!
When I cut this song I was right in the middle of dance rehearsals for my Vegas show...
@freeasmydick So cool! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
I think at my core, I am a dancer through and through. ;) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
And the next song is #BodyAche! I think this song speaks to my biggest passion which has always been dancing.
@teambritneyuk_ Omgoodness, me too. Tik Tik Tik  #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@daniel_tang @Tip It's a good one! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Seeing lots of these tweets! Hmmm.... RT @_DenverSean make #TikTikBoom a single. #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@famousrichard What show are you coming to?? #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Next up: #TikTikBoom!! I knew immediately that I had to have @Tip on this track! You guys dig it? #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Always fun in the studio w @iamwill RT @GGsaid this song is so fun, you must have had a great time making it! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@dafuqboys Luv u too! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Sometimes, we make love really complicated, but I've always felt It Should Be Easy :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
So much love to @sia for helping create such an amazing song!! Xo #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Sooner than you think! RT @britneyspeans My favorite! when are we getting the video? #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@TiffanyCarterxo Lips are sealed :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Can you guess who this song is about?
#Perfume is really just about relationship insecurities &amp; feeling insecure about the person you care for the most #BritneyJeanListeningParty
You better believe it! RT @dangerbritney Are u going to perform Work Bitch in Vegas? #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@TWY69 Hehe, nope don't have 1 of those either #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@CassPiamyheroes Get it girl! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@chdefreyn This is why I adore u all &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@chr14t12n One of mine too #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Such a massive fan. I def see myself working w him more in the future RT @StephanyValeIz #BritneyJeanListeningParty How was working w Orbit?
Sometimes I need to remind myself that i'm #NotAlone :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Song deals with loneliness and how you can be surrounded at all times by friends, family and adoring fans who you love and still feel alone.
Starting with Alien :) Loved working on this track with the very talented @WilliamOrbit! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
#BritneyJeanListeningParty starts now :) http://t.co/dps446FIFx

. @iflyselenagomez Ryan Gosling of course. LOL
. @HeckYesSelena It was an opportunity for me to learn a lot about technology and cars so that was fun.
. @HeckYesSelena: @selenagomez how was your experience filming #Getaway different than any other film you've been in?
. @sadserunade Yes, I cannot wait to make my next action movie.
. @OhPerfectSel No they shot most of the fast driving scenes before I got there, only when Ethan drove me around for a bit.
. @OhPerfectSel: @selenagomez @Getaway @Texasbeauty5 #Getaway were you scared during the extreme car rides?
. @DelenaNerds Yes! :)
. @HereForSMG_ The end of the movie because it is really Epic ending and I get to jump out of a car.
@HereForSMG_: @selenagomez @getaway what was your favourite scene to shoot? #Getaway
. @gomezfied All we really did off camera was go to McDonalds and sleep they were long days and we shot through the night.
. @jemmaselenator  being able to completely tranform myself and work with someone like Ethan.  I have always wanted to do an action movie.
@jemmaselenator: @selenagomez #Getaway what interested you in being a part of this movie? I love you so much!
. @lovatosgomez It depends on the scene, dramatic is more difficult I usually  like to be alone a couple of hours before.

expressing sexuality in art is not an invitation for disrespect !!! just like wearing a short skirt is not asking for assault.
seeing a lot of "but look how you portray yourself in videos and in your music! you're so sexual!" .... please hold.. next tweet... i repeat
@xxTirzaJessxx women (and men) can express themselves however they'd like !!! even loving sex!! this is not an invitation to be disrespected
@xxTirzaJessxx that's the thing. women expressing sexuality is often mistaken for "hi come disrespect me!!!!".. &amp; that's just not the case.

.@Its_Pema poverty is perpetuated by the lack of opportunities like universal access to quality ed. Education is a birthright-not a luxury
.@keithdhardy spending time with their kids, sending them to school early, giving them nutrition, stimulation and love
Agree! RT @arneduncan .@FeimM Please challenge all political leaders to invest in high quality learning opportunities for children 0-5.
.@saleosol education turns kids into productive citizens, is proven to boost GDPs of nations, and promotes global security and stability.
.@PreschoolNation Chile's model increased funds for ECD &amp; schools , virtually eliminated illiteracy &amp; drastically improved teacher training
.@KnowledgeAll Fund. pies descalzos es parte de una alianza con el gob. Nal. "Primero lo primero". Abriremos 24 centros de DIT para 2016!
.@DJRarela showing leaders how early ed gives back &amp; sharing success stories of transformed communities strengthens the case for investing
.@theonlywayisjam growing up surrounded by inequality made me intolerant to it, &amp; research showed me that education was the solution to it
.@Mellisebasan de acuerdo. faltan mas escuelas en los campos, mas compromisos de los gobiernos y el sector privado. Hay que presionar
.@stumpteacher babies have an innate thirst for knowledge and enjoy learning-making it fun through focused play is another way of bonding.
.@JoseRendon0 In ECD, bc kids who access it are better prepared to learn through primary, secondary &amp; higher ed, and thrive throughout life
.@keithdhardy unequal access to ed. affects nations rich &amp; poor, but in the US school dropouts will be reduced by increasing ECD programs
.@cynthiapve se desarrollan aptitudes cognitivas, motrices, sociales y de conducta que resultan en ninos exitosos en la escuela y la vida

Currently on a plane leaving Kurdistan in Iraq.. can't wait to share my incredible experience with you all.. @castcenters
@jblover12223 dunno. It doesn't feel worth it anymore. I'd rather do charity work tbh
I don't understand why people care so much about what I say in interviews? Do y'all watch the news? Don't y'all got shit to worry about?
@we_areforbidden apparently everything I say is offensive and disrespectful soooo.....
@selenagomezpps amen sister
@karaokejennjenn that's not what I said
@we_areforbidden or I get asked indirect or direct questions about her?
@plaidshirtdxys to be totally honest I don't remember ever saying that so if I did say anything my words were misunderstood
@foteiniioak not everyday. No one is every day. But I aim to be
Also don't forget that words can be taken out of context when doing interviews.. still not apologizing for saying what everyone want to say
I get asked questions. I answer them. Sue me.

Who's fault is it that teens can name more celebrity feuds than wars?
Is it our fault though? Has society fed into it or is this just easy business with everyone from blogs to magazines trying to cash in?
How many people can name someone on the FBI's top 10 most wanted list
We complain about how unfair paparazzi and tabloid rumors are but still buy the magazines to find out who's fucking who and who wore it best
I bet our country knows more about celebrities than they know about what's happening over seas or global warming
The world is weird
In the studio..... Gettin honest....
I love my Lovatics so fucking much
Fuck this.. I'm back bitches. And I'm coming back more honest than ever

country. It's a scary thought thinking about where our country could be if people don't chose what's best for us.
Everyone's entitled to their own opinions and beliefs. No judgement. But no matter what party you are for, we have to do what's best for our
We just need to remind ourselves that this race isn't one big reality show.. This is our country's future. What is best for the US?
All I'm saying is, the others all have experience being politicians...
If we're gonna get technical, all the US Presidential candidates are now "celebrities".
@nedlik71_ she didn't start out as one

@LaurenJauregui love you girl
Women empowerment is leading other women to make actual changes in our society.
Women empowerment is taking action now, not when it's convenient.
Women empowerment is using your voice to help the voiceless women be heard.
Women empowerment is speaking up for other women even when it's something uncomfortable to speak up about.
I'm also ready for self-proclaimed feminists to start speaking out or taking action for women's rights.
Someone tell me why anyone would ever feel brave enough to come forward if they are most likely to be ignored or called a liar?
Happens way too often. I'm ready for women to be taken just as seriously as men..
Frustrating to see women come forward with their past only to be shot down, not believed &amp; disrespected for their bravery in taking action

Surround yourself with those who pick you up when others put you down.
Compassion and empathy are key character traits to have in order to rebuild all relations with others.
And sometimes grudges aren't meant to be held but when words cut deep enough... It makes it really hard to move on.
It's important to remember. Sometimes your words may be forgiven but they cannot be forgotten.. Are your words worth it?
Best dad in the world https://t.co/v1Lo0PiogA
Check out this short film that my friends @blackcoff_ee did! Zach Williams Makes It Big Time. Watch at http://t.co/vmyq4ZyXWC
@espn @ufc @RondaRousey FUCK yeah!!!! Congrats girl!!
"Success comes when you want it more than you want to sleep... When you want it more than you need to breathe..."
@BeaMiller is such a little G
Looking back.. Those who told me what I didn't want to hear when I NEEDED to hear it are the ones I trust the most in my life today
If everyone around you agrees with you 100% of the time, you may want to reevaluate those around you...
Surround yourself with people who aren't afraid of your response to their honesty. Surround yourself with those who aren't afraid to say no.
The ones who are honest with you, are the ones who love you..

it's here... The changes I've made... It's a new journey... A new chapter in my life and I'm so fucking ready. #2015
can take away my individuality or copy my best work which my fans deserve to see. I'm sorry it took so long to figure out MY channel but
Fuck trying to make music that will appeal to the masses for the sake of hit songs. It's time to share my lane... MY SOUND.. Because no one
I am going to sing my heart out more than I've ever sang before.. To the sound that I've spent my whole life trying to identify.. I'm ready.
What I can say is this will be my best work yet... Already game changing music and I've barely scratched the surface on creating this album.
I can't describe my new sound... The only word that comes to mind is authentic. Very very authentic to who I am &amp; the voice I have inside..
I've never been more confident in my sound. Never been so sure of who I am as an artist. Never felt this hungry and driven...
@DimaBieber_ dude... So short.
3 years sober next month... Hell yeah!!! God is so good. My best friend created the universe and still takes time to love me. #soblessed
Sometimes I look at how far I've come in my personal journey and I'm like.. Holy shit.. I fucking conquered that like a boss!!
